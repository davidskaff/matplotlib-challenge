Prepare the Data: The first step in my analysis was to prepare the data. This involved reading the data from CSV files, merging the data into a single DataFrame, and cleaning the data by removing any duplicates.

Generate Summary: Statistics Next, I generated summary statistics for the study. This included calculating the mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volume for each drug regimen.

Create Bar Charts and Pie Charts: I visualized the data by creating bar charts and pie charts. The bar charts showed the total number of measurements taken for each treatment regimen, and the pie charts showed the distribution of female versus male mice in the study.

Calculate Quartiles, Find Outliers, and Create a Box Plot: I calculated the quartiles and IQR and determined if there were any potential outliers among the tumor volumes for each drug regimen. Then, I created a box plot of the final tumor volume for each mouse across the four treatment regimens of interest (Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin).

Create a Line Plot and a Scatter Plot: I created a line plot of tumor volume vs. time point for a single mouse treated with Capomulin, and a scatter plot of mouse weight versus average tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment regimen.

Calculate Correlation and Regression: Finally, I calculated the correlation coefficient and linear regression model for mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin regimen.
